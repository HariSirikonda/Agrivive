                                <p className="mx-2 ">At Agrivive, we are on a mission to transform untapped agricultural potential into sustainable opportunities for income and growth. We began our journey with a strong purpose: to empower landowners to unlock the true value of their lands. Over the years, we have observed a growing trend—families with a rich legacy of farming are shifting towards other professions, leaving ancestral lands unused. This shift, while providing new opportunities, raises a crucial question: how can we ensure that fertile lands are utilized effectively to contribute to food security, economic prosperity, and environmental sustainability?</p>
                                <h1 className="text-success p-2">The State of Indian Agriculture</h1>
                                <p className="mx-2 ">India, as an agrarian economy, contributes nearly 18-20% of GDP and employs over 50% of the population in agriculture and allied sectors. However, recent statistics highlight a troubling trend:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Nearly 12% of India’s arable land remains uncultivated, often due to migration or lack of interest in farming.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>The average age of farmers in India is now above 50 years, indicating a need for younger generations to engage in agriculture.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>With an increasing demand for organic produce, India’s organic farming penetration stands at just 2.78 million hectares, which is less than 3% of total agricultural land.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>These numbers underline an urgent need for innovation and participation in agriculture to address the growing gap in food production, land utilization, and ecological preservation.</p>
